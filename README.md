## Self-scoring Trivia

### Behind the Scenes



### User Stories:

As a player, I should be able to:

* tell the difference between my question and answer choices so I can submit an answer choice
* choose my answer on the same screen as the question so I can refer to the question while answering
* immediately see the correct answer after choosing so I can know if I chose correctly
* see my score so I can keep track of my performance (# of questions correct) while I play
* progress to the next question after answering so I can complete the entire quiz without skipping questions

### Original Prompt

Pre-load your app with some questions and answers.

Test the user's wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

Bonus:
* Add time-based scoring
* Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
* Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.
