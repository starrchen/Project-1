## Self-scoring Trivia

### User Stories:

As a player, I should be able to:

* enter my answer on the same screen as the question so I can refer to the question while answering
* choose when to submit my answer so I can only submit my answer when I am satisfied with it
* see my score so I can keep track of my performance (# of questions correct) while I play
* see what the trivia category is so I can anticipate what types of questions will be asked
* know what types of answers will be accepted as correct so that I can more accurately respond to prompts

### Prompt

Pre-load your app with some questions and answers.

Test the user's wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

Bonus:
* Add time-based scoring
* Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
* Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.
