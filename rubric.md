Meets/exceeds expectations. Great job with your read me. Seems like you put a decent amount of planning in to this application! Good user stories, I liked that they were very feature oriented.

Meets Expectations. Application is bug free. There's some great learning points and refactoring peppered throughout in the comments i've provided. Let me know if you have any questions about any in particular.
